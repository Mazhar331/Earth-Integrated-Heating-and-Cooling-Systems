# Earth-Integrated-Heating-and-Cooling-Systems
- Project on the comparison of two environmentally friendly heating and cooling solutions- Earth Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) and Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP).
- Python files to derive correlations for air density and viscosity as functions of temperature, and perform calculations pertaining to the heat duty, coefficient of performance, outlet temperature for the EAHE.
- The report summarizes the findings and results from various simulations, codes and techno-economic analyses.
