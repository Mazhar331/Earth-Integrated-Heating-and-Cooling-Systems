# Earth-Integrated-Heating-and-Cooling-Systems
- This project compares two environmentally friendly heating and cooling solutions- Earth Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) and Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP).
- The Python files were created to derive correlations for air density and viscosity as functions of temperature, and perform calculations pertaining to the heat duty, coefficient of performance, outlet temperature, etc. of the EAHE.
- The report summarizes the findings and results from various simulations, codes and techno-economic analyses.
